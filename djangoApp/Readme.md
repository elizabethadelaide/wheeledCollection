# Django App

Web application will hold data collected from Android application which has at least Accelerometer and Location data. The data will be processed
for peaks and frequency, and filetered. The data will be displayed using d3 for now, maybe leaflet (mapView) later.

## Current Progress

Basic test data generation of white noise, sine wave and peaks.

Peak detection and FFT

Django skeleton setup

Starting to put pieces together

Need to make a prototype front end, and enough visualizations to know if data collection is working
